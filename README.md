# OpenApi42 Examples

This repository contains examples that you can use as a starting point for using OpenApi42.

To use them, first run `npm install` to install everything. This will also trigger the build script for all api's.

Then you can run any of the examples by running `npm start` in the directory of an example.

If you are using vscode, you could also open the workspace file `OpenApi42-Examples.code-workspace` and use the configured launch commands.
